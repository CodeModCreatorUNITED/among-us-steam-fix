Fixes the Error "SteamworksAuthFail" bug for Among Us

When testing mods, it is a once in a while occurance of you encountering the popup "Could not connect to your Among Us Account. (Error SteamworksAuthFail)." This basically just fixes it by putting this single text file in your mod folder (yes that is it lol).). 


# How to Install
You download the file, then you would paste it in your mod file. Image for example.

Now you are free to launch Among Us and it should in theory work without problems.
